# Hi I am Lindsay!
I am an Australian who lives in Germany, having recently finished an intensive AWS Cloud Developer/DevOps course with Python as the programming language.
This repo. is a showcase of some project work which I have created. Everything from simple fun Python programs to containerized dash apps.
Have a look around.
