# Hi I am Lindsay!
I am an Australian who lives in Germany, having finished my an intensive AWS Cloud Developer/DevOps course with Python as programming language.
This is a showcase of some of my project work which I have created. Everything from simple fun Python programs to containerised dash apps.
Have a look around.
